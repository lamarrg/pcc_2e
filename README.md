I have forked the original repo and adding a code projects in python_work for each section showing the work I have completed.

NOTE: I am intentionally skipping project 1 as I want to focus on other aspects at this time.

I have also foregone the blog assignment in chapter 19 & 20 as I have posted some projects to the web outside of Heroku, and do not forsee using heroku in the near future. I have used it before, and if NEEDED, can do it again.
