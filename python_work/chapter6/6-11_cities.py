# Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the infor- mation you have stored about it.

cities = {
    'Albany': {
        'country': 'USA',
        'population': 720000,
        'fact': 'I think this is the capital of NY state.'
    },
    'Rio De Janero': {
        'country': 'Brazil',
        'population': 3000000,
        'fact': 'Has the giant Jesus statue.'
    },
    'Shanghai': {
        'country': 'China',
        'population': 6700000,
        'fact': 'A very big city.'
    }
}

for city in cities:
    print(f'\n{city}:')
    for k, v in cities[city].items():
        print(f'\t{k}: {v}')
