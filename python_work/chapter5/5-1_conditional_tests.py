# Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

# â€¢ Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

# â€¢ Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and another five tests evaluate to False.
