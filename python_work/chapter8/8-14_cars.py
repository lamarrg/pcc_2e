# Write a function that stores information about a car in a diction- ary. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the func- tion with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:
# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

def make_car(make, model, **car_details):
    """Build a dictionary with car details"""
    car_details['make'] = make
    car_details['model'] = model
    return car_details

new_car = make_car('Peugeot', 'Peugeot 505', color='Mint Green', brakes=True, tires=True)

print(new_car)
