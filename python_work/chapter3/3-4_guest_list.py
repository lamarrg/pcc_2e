# If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

dinner_invitees = ["Irdris Elba", "Neil DeGrasse Tyson", "Angela Timbur", "Salma Hayek"]

print(f'{dinner_invitees[0]}, would you like to come to dinner?!?!')
print(f'{dinner_invitees[1]}, would you like to come to dinner?!?!')
print(f'{dinner_invitees[2]}, would you like to come to dinner?!?!')
print(f'{dinner_invitees[3]}, would you like to come to dinner?!?!')
