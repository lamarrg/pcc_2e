# Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

fav_transportation = ["mountain bike", "go cart", "ATV", "hot air balloon"]

print(f'Can\'t wait to take my {fav_transportation[0]} for a spin!')
print(f'Can\'t wait to take my {fav_transportation[1]} for a spin!')
print(f'Can\'t wait to take my {fav_transportation[2]} for a spin!')
print(f'Can\'t wait to take my {fav_transportation[3]} for a spin!')
