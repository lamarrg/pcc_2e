# Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each mes- sage should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names = ["Steve", "Dave", "Casper", "Laurie"]


print(f'Hey, {names[0]}! How have you been?')
print(f'Hey, {names[1]}! How have you been?')
print(f'Hey, {names[2]}! How have you been?')
print(f'Hey, {names[3]}! How have you been?')
